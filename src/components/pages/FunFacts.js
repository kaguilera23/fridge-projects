                            One of my biggest goals is to see all the national parks in the United States. So far, my boyfriend and I have been to 6. I'm very proud of the hikes I do because I'm not a super athlete who finds hikes easy, but I definitely think they're worth it. They're also the biggest inspirations for my first project for travellers!

                            I was an ophthalmic technician for 3 years and loved my patients and job, but I wanted to combine my interests of typing, attention to detail, and creation into a career. I'm excited to work with clients and turn a small idea into a website even better than they imagined!

                            Althought the outdoors are fun, I absolutely love staying in and watching movies. My boyfriend and I will watch anything from The Notebook (don't ask how many times I've watched it) to Puss in Boots to The Witch and so many more. My personal favorites are rom-coms and horror/thrillers. You think I'd be tired of being in front of a screen all day!
