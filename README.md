# ðŸŒº Welcome to My Portfolio! ðŸŒº

You will be automatically taken to the "About Me" section of the website. Here, you can my email and click the link to send me a message. You can also download my resume, though my skills will be listed. There's a "Portfolio" page which showcases my proudest projects, ones that you could say were worthy of hanging on the fridge if you brought them home to your parents! Lastly, there's a "Fun Facts" section with, simply, the things I think people would find interesting (hopefully). Thanks for visiting!

### Errors

There were difficulties in navigating GitHub Pages with React, so this is a new repository with old code, resulting in a poor commit history. If you'd like, you can check out the original repository <a href="https://github.com/kaguilera23/family-fridge/tree/master">here</a> for a better history.
